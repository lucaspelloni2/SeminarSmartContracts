\subsection{What is a Blockchain?}
\subsubsection{Source of Trust}
%http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp
%A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as "completed" blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order.
Blockchain will become a global decentralised source of trust.
Everything that is centralized makes it easy to attack because it offers a single point of failure. 
(e.g. Firewall of a website). 
Application built with Bloch chain technlogy do not require  users to trust the developers with personal information or funds.

\section{Smart Contract: Introduction}
\subsection{Smart Contract: a self-executing contractual agreements}
%definition founded here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkeLDPZ-v8g&t=134s
A Smart Contract is a piece of software that stores rules for negotiating the terms of a contract, automatically verifies the contract and then executes the agreed terms.
